# Financial Analysis and Stock Prediction Using LSTM Neural Networks

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for my final project at Doğuş University. The project focuses on financial analysis and stock price prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The goal is to predict BIST30 stock prices based on historical data, with a specific focus on stocks such as THYAO.IS and TUPRS.IS.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Development and training of LSTM neural network models
- Financial data analysis and visualization
- Performance evaluation and comparison with traditional models
- Prediction of stock prices for THYAO.IS and TUPRS.IS

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial-analysis-lstm.git
   cd financial-analysis-lstm
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and open the main notebook file `Financial_Analysis_and_Stock_Prediction.ipynb`.

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.

4. Alternatively, you can run the notebook in Google Colab. Open the following link and upload the notebook file:
   [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

## Results

The project achieved significant improvements in stock price prediction accuracy through various performance metrics:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 15.98
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 4.00
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 2.74
- **R-squared (R²):** 0.99
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):** 2.82%

These metrics demonstrate the model's effectiveness in capturing complex patterns in stock price data, resulting in more accurate predictions.
